Header Footer Scripts Manager plugin allows you to add scripts to WordPress site's <head> and just before closing </body> tag.

== Description ==
This plugin will help you add custom js scripts or css styles to your individual pages or across the whole site very easily. Code can be anything from social media scripts to google analytics etc. Code can be injected to head tag or in footer before body end.

Below html syntax should be followed for adding js and css

Don't forget to wrap your code with proper tags from settings page or in edit screen of any particular page.

	<script type="text/javascript">
	INSERT JS HERE
	</script>

Or for CSS:

	<style type="text/css">
	INSERT CSS HERE
	</style>

= Why this plugin: =
* To insert CSS and JavaScript codes to `<head>` or before `</body>` to all the pages.
* To insert code to `<head>` of any specific page or post and will be unique for that page.
* There are numerous services like google analytics, google adwords or adsense etc. that ask to insert scripts into your pages so this plugin can be very handy for adding such services to your site and also for custom styling or adding your js functionalities.

All the wordpress themes and plugins should support this plugin as it is quite generic functionality and if any script or style does not work please do check that you followed the proper syntax as suggested above for js and css and also please make sure the theme you have activated do have 'wp_head' and 'wp_footer' hooks in it.
